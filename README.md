# Computational Neuroscience System

## Goal
Build an end-to-end neural decoding and control system that transforms neural signals into adaptive control.

## System Overview
- Input: EEG neural signals
- Features: Time and frequency domain features
- Decoder: Linear models with incremental learning
- Output: Continuous control signal (cursor control)
- Loop: Closed-loop learning with feedback

## Project Structure
- notebooks/: exploration and experiments
- src/: reusable code for features, decoding, and control
- data/: raw and processed datasets
- notes/: design decisions and reflections

## Status
Phase 0 — System scaffolding
